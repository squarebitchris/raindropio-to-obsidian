<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

**Heads up! ðŸ“¢:** As of right now, you need to set up a RaindropIO bearer token to use this plugin. However, I'm working on another option so that you won't have to go through that hassle. Keep your eyes peeled for version 2.0.0 ðŸ˜Ž

### Bearer token

### Step 1: Raindrop Config
1. Go to the [Raindrop App Management Dashboard](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations)
2. Create Test Application?
3. Store in settings

To use this tool, you'll need to set up an application and get a bearer token on the  [Raindrop App Management Dashboard](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations).
